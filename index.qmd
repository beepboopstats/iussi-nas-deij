### _Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice_ committee for the IUSSI North American section.

\
__A brief introduction here__
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 

This website is aimed to:

- __point 1__, description of point 1
- __point 2__, description of point 2
- __point 3__, description of point 3
- __point 4__, description of point 4
