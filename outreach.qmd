The __IUSSI-NAS DEIJ Outreach Program__ was started to serve as an 
umbrella program for DEIJ-related initiatives and outreach, not only across 
IUSSI-NAS, but to reach non-members as well.

For the initial phase of the program, we have identified three primary branches 
that we are currently working on: 

1. __Turner-Collins Recognition Program__ 
2. __Professional Development Workshop Series__, and
3. __Fundraising__ to create a `DEIJ Outreach Fund` that can provide monetary support \
  for current and future DEIJ initiatives of IUSSI-NAS members.
