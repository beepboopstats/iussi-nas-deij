Like the diversity found in a social insect society, having a diverse membership leads to better overall outcomes, and ultimately advances scientific knowledge. IUSSI-NAS is working to support diversity, accessibility, and inclusion efforts by creating opportunities for participation and advancement in social insect science as a whole and actively opposing racism and all other forms of discrimination and harassment. We will listen, learn from, and work with our members from all career stages and backgrounds to build a more diverse, equitable, inclusive, and just community of social insect researchers.

    "text": "The Turner-Collins Award encourages and recognizes efforts to promote interest in biology among African-Americans and Native-Americans using social insects and related material, by IUSSI-NAS members, or persons observed by them (for example, a non-member teacher).\nThis award is inspired by the work and advocacy of two African-American researchers. Charles H. Turner (1867-1923) was a noted student of social wasps, ants and bees. Margaret Collins (1922-1996) was a taxonomist and natural historian of termites. Both were dedicated to the promotion of the well-being and education of their fellow Black Americans. This award encourages scientists, students and community members associated with the IUSSI-NAS to use their special interests for humanitarian ends: improvement of public access to knowledge, especially among children, young people, and concerned parents in these historically excluded groups. Nominees do not have to be members of IUSSI and may be citizens of any country, so long as they have engaged or are actively engaged in projects that promote black and/or Native American representation in Social Insect Science somewhere in North America.\nSee the current call for nominations below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the full call for nomination\n\n\n\n\n\n﻿CALL FOR NOMINATIONS:\nTurner-Collins Award\nDue December 1, 2025\n\nPurpose: To encourage and recognize efforts to promote interest in biology among African Americans and Native Americans using social insects and related material. Nature: The award shall consist of a certificate of recognition that can be listed among the outreach achievements valued by institutions of learning and employment. The awardees will be announced by December 30, 2025. The program is inspired by the work and advocacy of two African American researchers. Charles H. Turner (1867- 1923) was a noted student of social wasps, ants and bees. Margaret Collins (1922- 1996) was a taxonomist and natural historian of termites. Both were dedicated to the promotion of the well-being and education of their fellow Black Americans. This award encourages scientists, students and community members associated with the IUSSI- NAS to use their special interests for humanitarian ends: improvement of public access to knowledge, especially among children, young people, and concerned parents in these historically excluded groups.\nEligibility: The award will be given to people who have engaged or are currently engaged in impactful activities that increase Black and/or Native American representation in the field of Social Insect Science. These outreach activities should generally take place somewhere in North America (inclusive of Canada, the USA, and Mexico), though projects within the spirit of the award, but taking place in whole or in part outside of North America will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Non-IUSSI members and citizens of any country are eligible. Reviewable actions must have taken place within the last 5 years.\nNominations: Self nominations are encouraged. Each nomination packet should consist of a single PDF containing the following sections:\n\nCover page – includes the following information about the nominee:\n\n\nName of nominee\nAffiliation of nominee (e.g. institution and Department)\nPosition (e.g. Graduate Student, Associate Professor, K-12 Teacher)\nMailing address\nEmail address\n\n\nOne-page description of Turner-Collins related project that explicitly specifies:\n\n\nInclusion of African-American and/or Native-American participants\nMagnitude of positive impact (Discuss the number of people affected and “quality” of positive impact)\nDuration of project (Was this a one-time event or a long-term initiative?)\nLevel of specificity (To what extent is/was this project a successful effort to increase representation in the target population?)\nMention if there was any collaboration with established organizations or individuals working towards DEIJ objectives (optional). For example: working with on-campus black student organizations, etc. The nominee must appreciably add value beyond what that organization was already doing without them.\n\n\nA letter of support, less than 2 pages, from one or more person(s) familiar with the project. This could be a student, a participant, an advisor, or other community member (non- confidential, to be included in the compiled PDF).\nAn up-to-date CV or resumé of the applicant/nominee.\n\nAdditional documents, such as photographs or media reports of the project may be attached to the application but are not required.\nEmail compiled PDF document to iussi.nas.deij@gmail.com by December 1, 2025."
