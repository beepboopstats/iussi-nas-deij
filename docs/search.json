Like the diversity found in a social insect society, having a diverse membership leads to better overall outcomes, and ultimately advances scientific knowledge. IUSSI-NAS is working to support diversity, accessibility, and inclusion efforts by creating opportunities for participation and advancement in social insect science as a whole and actively opposing racism and all other forms of discrimination and harassment. We will listen, learn from, and work with our members from all career stages and backgrounds to build a more diverse, equitable, inclusive, and just community of social insect researchers. You can reach out to the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice (DEIJ) Committee anytime with thoughts and concerns.\nEmail: iussi.nas.deij@gmail.com."
